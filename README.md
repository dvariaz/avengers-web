### Implementation

I used these react features and libraries:

-   React Hooks
-   Context API
-   Styled Components
-   React Router
-   Framer Motion
-   Sass (With CSS Modules)

I really like the CSS Modules + Styled Components combination for separate static and dynamic styles.

### What I learned?

React router hooks (>v5.1) are too useful for store the navigation state globally, I've removed Context/Redux sometimes during this project.

You can run the project running the command:

`npm start`

This project is based on the design of **Manuel Rovira** [Visit his portfolio!](https://www.behance.net/gallery/64907137/Avengers-Infinity-War)
